## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

Open Source Software is not about the code in the first place but the communications and community. People love good documentation and obvious workflows. If your software solves some problem, but nobody can figure out how to use it or, for example, how to create an effective bug report, there's something very bad going on.

additional labels, code scanning, and automatic issue/PR closing and locking you have to do much more work. Your time should be focused on creating something **amazing**. You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating your GitHub project template from scratch. Follow the **don‚Äôt repeat yourself** principle. Use a template **and go create something amazing**!

Key features of **Hive.Et**:

- Configurable README.md template
- Configurable LICENSE template
- Configurable CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md template
- Configurable CONTRIBUTING.md template
- Configurable SECURITY.md template
- Configurable issues template
- Pull request template
- CODEOWNERS template
- Additional labels template
- Automatic locking for closed issues and PRs workflow
- Automatic cleaning for stale issues and PRs workflow
- Automatic label verification for PRs workflow
- Automatic security code scanning workflow via CodeQL

<summary>Additional info</summary>
<br>

This project is the result of huge research. I'm a long-time GitHub user so I've seen more than [7.3k](https://github.com/GedionT?tab=stars) READMEs so far. I've started writing docs for my open source projects (that are currently in their early stages so they exist in the private space for now). After I've **analyzed many popular GitHub** READMEs and other GitHub-related docs and features I've tried to create a general-propose template that may be useful for any project.
