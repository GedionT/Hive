This project is built based on Microsoft's Guide of Design System based on Material UI
Our component libraries are from Fluent UI - based on Microsoft's Design System

This project is the result of huge research. I'm a long-time GitHub user so I've seen more than [7.3k](https://github.com/GedionT?tab=stars) READMEs so far. I've started writing docs for my open source projects (that are currently in their early stages so they exist in the private space for now). After I've **analyzed many popular GitHub** READMEs and other GitHub-related docs and features I've tried to create a general-propose template that may be useful for any project.
